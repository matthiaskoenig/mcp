1 Übung Metabolische Kontrollanalyse & einfache Signalnetzwerke



Protein phosphorylation & cellular singaling
=============================================
until now: metabolism

.. math:: \frac{d \vec{x}}{dt}  = N \cdot \vec{v}

describes: mass flow; metabolic flux

now: **signal transduction**
- a signal is activating a signal transduction pathway which ultimately results
in a *cellular response*



Ph

typical systems and their dynamic:
- MAPK and 2 Komponent systems
- Chemotaxis
- Dynamic of small network motives (Tyson & Novak)
- Adaptiation, Ultrasensitivity,
- Input-Output relationships

x = f(S)

**Beipiel: 2 Komponenten-System

-> response regulator diffusable


**phosphorylation cycle**
One of the most important signaling motives are protein phosphorylation cycles, i.e., a post-translational modification of a protein in which an amino acid residue is phosphorylated by a protein kinase, and dephosphorylated by a protein phosphatase.

Phosphorylation is a very common mechanism for regulating the activity of enzymes and is the most common post-translational modification.

Many alternative protein modifications exist which can be modelled in very similar manner
- glycosylation
- acetylation
- lipidation
...

Phosphorylation changes the structural conformation of the protein, the phosphorylated protein has a modified function (e.g. phosphorylation may activate or deactivate a protein)

.. math:: v_1 = k_1 \cdot x \cdot S
.. math:: v_1 = k_1 \cdot x \cdot S
