Stochastic processes
=====================
- Traditional approach: deterministic systems, described by ODE rate equations
- Only approximation: large molecule numbers, well stirred compartments & bulk reactions.

Stochastic approach:
- master equation: evolution of probability distribution
- Gillespie algorithm: individual stochastic trajectories
