10 Stochastic processes
========================
- `lecture notes <./_static/10_stochastic_processes.pdf>`_

Traditional approach:

- deterministic systems, described by ODE rate equations
- Only approximation: large molecule numbers, well stirred compartments & bulk reactions

Stochastic approach:

- master equation: evolution of probability distribution
- Gillespie algorithm: individual stochastic trajectories
